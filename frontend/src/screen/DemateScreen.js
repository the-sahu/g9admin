                    You must understand what is mean by Demat Account. Just as your bank account stores your money, your Demat account holds your shares, securities, bonds, mutual funds and other assets. However, these are held digitally or as electronic copies and hence are in a dematerialised form. This makes it safe, easier and convenient for you to transact once you start trading using one of the best Demat accounts in India.

                    You can quickly invest in capital markets online as well as hold, monitor and trade seamlessly using a Demat account which acts as a warehouse that stocks all your investments. One way to visualise this is to compare this to a godown where a businessman who sells detergent soaps stores the stock received from the manufacturer to sell it further to retail stores. You also need to open a trading account to buy and sell securities in your Demat account. Trading account acts as a bridge between the Demat and the bank account.

                    Even the best demat account in India from a brokerage comes with a trading account, bundled together. Trading account reflects cash flow-debit or credit unlike a Demat account which acts as a storage space for your securities. Whenever you want to buy or sell stocks, a request is placed for the same in your trading account which is forwarded by your Depository participant to the stock exchange.

                    <p className="text-base text-justify px-4 pt-4">
                    If you have placed a request to buy, the stock exchange looks for someone willing to sell the particular quantity of shares. Clearance houses are issued orders to debit shares from the Demat account of the seller and credit it to you, the buyer. However, when you want to sell securities, either derivatives or shares, the sale proceeds get credited to the trading account linked with your Demat account within 2 days or more. The money can then be transferred to your bank account.

                    Much like a Demat account, a trading account is also vital for investing in the share market. It allows you to electronically buy or sell shares and other securities in the stock market. Back when physical share certificates still existed, the stock exchanges used an open outcry system. According to this method, traders who wished to buy or sell shares had to be physically present in the stock exchanges and had to verbally communicate with the other parties. However, ever since the stock market went completely electronic, the open outcry system has been replaced entirely by online trading accounts.

                    With an online trading account, you do not need to be physically present in the stock exchanges to place buy or sell orders. You can simply use your trading account from anywhere in the world to buy or sell shares. This has not only simplified the entire share trading process, but it has also facilitated extremely quick settlements and deliveries.                    </p>

                    An online trading account allows you to trade in multiple stock exchanges simultaneously. This was impossible during the initial days of the stock market, when all the shares and scrips were held physically. Also, you get to enjoy access to all the leading stock exchanges in India such as Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE), National Stock Exchange (NSE), Multi Commodity Exchange (MCX), and National Commodity and Derivatives Exchange (NCDEX). What’s even more interesting is that you can access all of these exchanges via a single platform.

                    When it comes to the financial markets, there’s no guarantee that things will always go as planned. That’s why it is critical to choose a trading account with an exceptional customer support backing it up. Ideally, the support team of a trading account should be responsive, understanding, and provide quality service in the event of a problem with the service.
